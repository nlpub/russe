title: Text Detoxification Based on Parallel Corpora
---

Identification of toxicity in user texts is an active area of research. While algorithms in social networks and chats automatically identify and block comments with toxic speech, we suggest a proactive reaction to toxicity from the user. Namely, we aim at suggesting a neutral version of a user message which preserves meaningful content.
 
We invite you to participate in the shared task on text detoxification for the Russian language:
