# Russian Text Detoxification Based on Parallel Corpora 

Identification of toxicity in user texts is an active area of research. While algorithms in social networks and chats automatically identify and block comments with toxic speech, we suggest a proactive reaction to toxicity from the user. Namely, we aim at suggesting a neutral version of a user message which preserves meaningful content. We denote this task as detoxification. 

Detoxification can be solved with Text Style Transfer (TST) [1] methods. There already exist unsupervised approaches to detoxification [2, 3] trained without parallel corpora for the Russian and English languages. However, the output of these models is often of bad quality.

To boost the research in the area of detoxification for Russian, we collected a parallel corpus of toxic sentences and their manually written non-toxic paraphrases. We make this corpus available and invite the participants of the shared task to create models

## Task Formulation

We present the first of its kind TST competition with parallel corpora and human evaluation. More specifically, we address the problem of transferring style from toxic into non-toxic for the Russian language.

The task of detoxification can be formulated as follows: given texts in the toxic style, we want to paraphrase them to the non-toxic style, preserving the content and generating fluent text.

For example:

|| toxic sentence | detoxified sentence |
| --- | --- | --- |
||из за таких пидоров мы и страдаем | Из-за таких людей мы и страдаем |
|*translation:*|*We suffer from such faggots*| *We suffer from such people* |
||хуй знает кто кум, но девушка красивая👍 | неизвестно кто кум, но девушка красивая |
|*translation:*|*fuck knows who the godfather is, but the girl is beautiful 👍*|*it is unknown who the godfather is, but the girl is beautiful*|
||порядок бы блять навёл ! | Порядок бы навел |
|*translation:*|*Put these fucking things in order*|*Put the things in order*|

Everyone interested in TST and detoxification is welcome to participate. The participants are allowed to use any additional datasets or models if they are publicly available. However, we ask participants to mention all additional resources used for the training of models. The participants can test their models on the public test set by submitting the results to the leaderboard. Once the private test set is released, the participants will have a week to detoxify test sentences and submit their final results.

## Dataset

For this shared task, we compiled a new dataset with parallel data for detoxification. We hired workers via Yandex.Toloka platform (link). 

The whole pipeline consists of three tasks:

* **Paraphrase generation.** The annotators are asked to generate the neutral paraphrase of the input text. They can also select a choice not to rewrite the input if the text is already neutral or it is difficult to extract non-toxic content.

Of course, the annotators can write anything as a paraphrase. However, we have very strict criteria to style-transferred text – the text must be now in neutral style and the content must be preserved. To ensure this, we validate received paraphrases with the next tasks.

* **Content preservation check.** Given to texts – original toxic sentence and generated paraphrase – the annotators should validate, if these texts are with similar content. 

* **Toxicity classification.** Given the generated paraphrase, the annotators should classify it into one of the classes – toxic or neutral.

If the generated paraphrase receives correct answers with high (>=90%) confidence, then it gets into our dataset.

For the original data, we took the toxic part of the toxic classification datasets based on [Odnoklassniki](https://www.kaggle.com/blackmoon/russian-language-toxic-comments) and [Pikabu](https://www.kaggle.com/alexandersemiletov/toxic-russian-comments). As a result, We collected a dataset with paraphrases for **5026** toxic sentences, each having **1-3** paraphrase variants, resulting in **7058** paraphrases overall. 

## Evaluation

As TST is quite a new and difficult task to evaluate, there are several works dedicated to the choice of metrics for this task. As in our competition we propose a new parallel corpus for detoxification tasks and now can refer to TST tasks like machine translation tasks, we want to use the best practices of machine translation competitions and hold two parts of submissions evaluation – automatic and human.

### Automatic Evaluation

The goals of a style transfer model are to (i) change the text style, (ii) preserve the
content, and (iii) yield a grammatical sentence. Thus, the automatic evaluation phase consists of the following metrics:


* **Style transfer accuracy (STA).** Bert-based classifier (fine-tuned from Conversational Rubert) trained on merge of Russian Language Toxic Comments dataset collected from 2ch.hk and Toxic Russian Comments dataset collected from ok.ru. Link: <https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/russian_toxicity_classifier> 
* **Meaning preservation score (SIM)** is evaluated as cosine similarity of [LaBSE sentence embeddings](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01852>). For computational optimization, we use the model version <https://huggingface.co/cointegrated/LaBSE-en-ru>, which is original LaBSE from Google with embeddings for languages other than Russian and English stripped away.
* **Fluency score (FL)** is evaluated with the weakly supervised classifier (<https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/rubert-base-corruption-detector>). This BERT-based model has been trained to distinguish 780 thousand texts from Odnoklassniki and Pikabu toxicity datasets and a few [web corpora](<https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download>) from their corrupted versions. The corruptions included random replacement, deletion, addition, shuffling, and re-inflexion of words and characters, random changes of capitalization, round-trip translation, filling random gaps with T5 and RoBERTA models.
* **Joint score (J):** This is the metric by which the ranking of automatic evaluation on phase will be conducted. This metric is calculated as a superposition of three metrics -STA, SIM, and FL: J = (STA * SIM * FL)
* **[ChrF1](https://github.com/m-popovic/chrF):** While all previous metrics compare the output of the model with the original toxic sentences, this metric uses neutral references for the comparison.


### Human Evaluation

After private set submissions, we are going to select the best model for each participant based on an automatically calculated J score. These submissions will be used for the final ranking phase – human evaluation.

We are going to use Yandex.Toloka platform to evaluate participants’ results on a private test set. The texts will be as well evaluated based on three parameters – style transfer accuracy, content preservation, and fluency:

* **Style transfer accuracy (STA).** Given the generated paraphrase, the annotators should classify it into one of the classes – toxic or neutral.
* **Content preservation check (CP).** Given to texts – original toxic sentence and generated paraphrase – the annotators should validate if these texts are with similar content.
* **Fluency task (FL).** The annotators validate if the text is written correctly and meaningful.
* **Joint score (J):** This is the metric by which the ranking of manual evaluation on phase will be conducted. This metric is calculated as a superposition of three metrics -STA, CP, and FL: J = (STA * CP * FL). **THIS METRIC J WILL BE USED FOR THE FINAL RANKING OF THE PARTICIPANTS.**
 
The final table with results will be published on the [competition web-page](https://russe.nlpub.org/2022/tox/).

## Baselines

We provide several baselines for this task: a rule-based Delete approach and an approach based on the [T5 model](https://huggingface.co/sberbank-ai/ruT5-base). 

* **Delete:** This is a simple unsupervised method that eliminates toxic words based on a predefined toxic words vocabulary. The idea is often used on television and other media: rude words are bleeped out or hidden with special characters (usually an asterisk). 

* **T5-base:** This is the supervised baseline based on the T5 model. We trained the [ruT5-base model](https://huggingface.co/sberbank-ai/ruT5-base) on the train part of our dataset.


You are welcome to test other brand new Russian Encoder-Decoder models (like GPT-2, GPT-3, T5, etc.) or other monolingual or multilingual Transformers.  Also, we are expecting to see interesting modifications of classical Seq2Seq models or even brand-new approaches.
