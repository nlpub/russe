# RUSSE

**RUSSE** is series of workshops on Russian Semantic Evaluation. Each workshop is centered around a shared task on a specific topic related to the semantic processing of the Russian language. There are three shared tasks:

* [Text detoxification based on parallel corpora](/2022/tox/) (2022)
* [Taxonomy Enrichment](/2020/isa/) (2020)
* [Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation](/2018/wsi/) (2018)
* [Semantic Relatedness and Similarity](/2015/sim/) (2015)

Traditionally, results of RUSSE are disseminated at the [Dialogue](http://www.dialog-21.ru/en/) series of conferences.
